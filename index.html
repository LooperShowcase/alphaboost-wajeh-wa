      largest manufacturer of image sensors, the second largest camera
      manufacturer, and is among the semiconductor sales leaders.[12][11][13] It
      is the world's largest player in the premium TV market for a television of
      at least 55 inches (140 centimeters) with a price higher than $2,500 as
      well as second largest TV brand by market share and, as of 2020, the third
      largest television manufacturer in the world by annual sales
      figures.[14][15][16][17] Sony Group Corporation is the holding company of
